Step 1 Data Is Generated at the Edge

Devices such as sensors smartphones cameras and machines constantly produce data  like temperature motion or video footage

Step 2 Local processing at the Edge

Rather than sending everything to the cloud edge computing allows that data to be filtered and analyzed locally right where its created  often on the device or a nearby mini server

Step 3 Only Important Data Is Sent to the Cloud

 Routine Data GPS location updates while driving in a straight line are handled locally within the car and dont need to be sent out

 Urgent Data If the car detects an obstacle makes a sudden brake or is involved in a collision that information is instantly sent to the cloud or a monitoring system for immediate action

Benefits of Machine Learning using Edge Computing
Data Volumes Traditional cloud computing architecture may not be able to keep up with the massive volume of data that is often generated by IoT devices and sensors thus increasing costs as well as pressure and congestion on the networks transmitting data 5 With edge computing architectures machine learning can be deployed in a distributed nature allowing ML models to be deployed and trained across many edge devices The nature of edge devices sharing computational tasks makes it perfect for taking large datasets and splitting the computational load so that many devices can compute what a single device might not have been able to handle 5 More than just splitting input data across edge devices machine learning models can be split up across edge devices as well This allows for deployment of models that would be otherwise too large to be deployed on a single edge device with limited memory In such cases edge nodes are able to collaboratively pass data between them and the global ML model is later updated based on the workings of each smaller portion 5 Additionally the sheer amount of data that processed from edge devices means more training data for machine learning models which generally increases accuracy and thus edge computing could be an effective solution to providing lots of good and relevant data for a variety of applications 

Lower Latency For certain realtime applications such as Virtual and Augmented RealityVRAR or smart cars the latency required to transmit data and process it to the cloud may be too high to make these applications efficient and safe A key benefit of edge computing lies in the reduced latency provided by putting devices closer to the users and this is applicable to machine learning as well 5

Enhanced privacy Processing data locally rather than on the cloud reduces the risk of data theft and enhances privacy The data does not have to be sent to anyone else or go over a network to potentially get compromised This is crucial given the large amounts of data needed for machine learning and especially if personal data is needed for a personal application many users would prefer the privacy done by having it processed locally 5

Benefits
One significant advantage of training ML models directly on edge devices is reduced latency By processing data locally devices can make immediate decisions without the delays caused by transmitting data back and forth to cloud servers This immediate responsiveness is extremely important for applications like real time health monitoring autonomous driving and industrial automation

Additionally training machine learning models at the edge significantly enhances user privacy Since sensitive data can be processed and stored directly on the users device rather than being sent to centralized cloud servers the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access during transmission is reduced by a lot This local data handling is able to prevent exposure of personal or confidential information providing users greater control over their data Edgebased training naturally aligns with privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which emphasizes strict data security transparency and explicit user consent By keeping personal data localized edge training not only improves security but also helps organizations easily comply with privacy laws protecting users rights and maintaining trust

Efficiency and resilience are important benefits of edge training By training machine learning models directly on edge devices these devices become capable of processing data locally without relying on constant internet connectivity This local processing allows edge devices to continue operating effectively even in environments where network connections are weak unstable or completely unavailable Because they are not fully dependent on cloud infrastructure edge devices can quickly adapt to changes respond in realtime and update their ML models based on immediate local data As a result edge training ensures reliable performance and uninterrupted operation making it particularly valuable for remote locations emergency scenarios and harsh environments where cloudbased solutions might fail or become unreliable


Examples 
A smart thermostat in a home can learn a users preferences for temperature and adjust automatically based on realtime inputs like time of day or weather conditions Similarly a fitness tracker can track user activity patterns and adapt its recommendations for workouts or rest periods based on how the user is performing each day These devices dont need to rely on cloud servers to update or personalize their behavior  they can do it instantly on the device which makes them more responsive and efficient

In smart agriculture edge computing is used to enhance crop monitoring and optimize farming practices Devices like soil sensors drones and automated irrigation systems are equipped with sensors that collect data on soil moisture temperature and crop health Edge devices process this data locally enabling realtime decisions for tasks like irrigation fertilization and pest control

Model Compression Techniques
Despite the challenges of ML at the edge there are a variety of methods that can be used to provide a more efficient means of training and making the heavy workloads compatible with even the limited computing power of certain edge devices

Quantization
Quantization is a method that involves reducing the precision of numbers and thus easing the burden of computational power as well as memory management on the edge devices There are multiple forms of quantization but each one essentially sacrifices some precision  enough so that accuracy is mostly maintained but the numbers are easier to handle For example converting from floating point to integer datatypes means significantly less memory is used and the differences for some models in the precision may be negligible Another example is Kmeans based Weight Quantization which involves creating a matrix and grouping similar numbers together with centroids An example is shown below

In recent work Quantized Neural Networks QNNs have demonstrated that even extreme quantizationsuch as using just 1bit values for weights and activationscan retain near stateoftheart accuracy across vision and language tasks 12 This type of quantization drastically reduces memory access requirements and replaces expensive arithmetic operations with fast lowpower bitwise operations like XNOR and popcount These benefits are especially important for edge deployment where energy efficiency is critical In addition to model compression Hubara et al also show that quantized gradientsusing as little as 6 bitscan be employed during training with minimal performance loss further enabling efficient ondevice learning 12 QNNs have achieved strong results even on demanding benchmarks like ImageNet while offering significant speedups and memory savings making them one of the most practical solutions for edge AI deployment 12


Pruning
Pruning is an optimization technique that systematically removes lowsalience parameterssuch as weakly contributing weights or redundant hypothesis pathsfrom a machine learning model or decoding algorithm to reduce computational overhead In the context of edge computing where resources like memory bandwidth power and processing time are limited pruning enables the deployment of performant models within strict efficiency constraints

In statistical machine translation SMT systems pruning is particularly critical during the decoding phase where the search space of possible translations grows exponentially with sentence length Techniques such as histogram pruning and threshold pruning are employed to manage this complexity Histogram pruning restricts the number of candidate hypotheses retained in a decoding stack to a fixed size  discarding the remainder Threshold pruning eliminates hypotheses whose scores fall below a proportion  of the bestscoring candidate effectively filtering out weak candidates early

The paper by Banik et al introduces a machine learningbased dynamic pruning framework that adaptively tunes pruning parametersnamely stack size and beam thresholdbased on structural features of the input text such as sentence length syntactic complexity and the distribution of stop words Rather than relying on static hyperparameters this method uses a classifier CN2 algorithm trained on performance data to predict optimal pruning configurations at runtime Experimental results showed consistent reductions in decoding latency up to 90 while maintaining or improving translation quality as measured by BLEU scores 13

This adaptive pruning paradigm is highly relevant to edge inference pipelines where models must maintain a balance between latency and predictive accuracy By intelligently limiting the hypothesis space and focusing computational resources on highprobability paths pruning supports realtime resourceefficient processing in edge NLP and embedded translation systems

Distillation
Distillation is a key strategy for reducing model complexity in edge computing environments Instead of training a compact student model on hard labelsdiscrete class labels like 0 1 or 2it is trained on the soft outputs of a larger teacher model These soft labels represent probability distributions over all classes offering more nuanced supervision For instance rather than telling the student the input belongs strictly to class 3 a teacher might output 70 class 3 25 class 2 5 class 1 This richer feedback helps the student model capture subtle relationships between classes that hard labels miss Beyond reducing computational demands distillation enhances generalization by conveying more informative training signals It also benefits from favorable data geometrywhen class distributions are wellseparated and alignedand exhibits strong monotonicity meaning the student model reliably improves as more data becomes available 11 These properties make it exceptionally suited for edge devices where training data may be limited but efficient inference is crucial 

In most cases knowledge distillation in edge environments involves a large highcapacity model trained in the cloud acting as the teacher while the smaller lightweight student model is deployed on edge devices A less commonbut emergingpractice is edgetoedge distillation where a more powerful edge node or edge server functions as the teacher for other nearby edge devices This setup is especially valuable in federated collaborative or hierarchical edge networks where cloud connectivity may be limited or privacy concerns necessitate local training Distillation can also be combined with techniques such as quantization or pruning to further optimize model performance under hardware constraints An example is shown below

Usage and Applications of AI Agents
As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies continue to mature they pave the way for the development of intelligent AI agents capable of autonomous contextaware behavior with the goal of efficiently performing tasks specified by users These agents combine perception reasoning and decisionmaking to execute tasks with minimal human intervention When deployed on edge devices AI agents can operate with low latency preserve user privacy and adapt to local datamaking them ideal for realtime personalized applications in homes vehicles factories and beyond

To function effectively an agent must first perceive its environment and understand the taskoften defined by the user Then it must reason about the optimal steps to accomplish that task and finally it must act on those decisions These three componentsperception reasoning and actionare essential to the agents ability to operate accurately and autonomously in dynamic environments

Reasoning The agent must be able to think sequentially and decompose its specified tasks into a sequence of specific steps in order to accomplish its goal It must also have some memory storage in order to remember what it has done as well as the results of its sequence of actions in order to learn for future steps

Autonomy The agent must choose from the availability of possible steps and operate based on its reasoning without stepbystep instructions from the user

Tools These tasks however are impossible to accomplish without the correct tools Even if an AI agent understands how to go about carrying a task for optimal results it must have the actual means to do it This can include the ability to use and interact with APIs interpret code and access certain databases 

Utilizing AI agents on edge devices can be tricky due to the computational and reasoning power needed However there are methods to accomplish this such as SLMs which query LLMs as needed discussed later or utilizing more powerful edge devices to carry out tasks However utilizing edge devices can be paramount if latency is a major issue or if the agent is exposed to sensitive user data Additionally by using edge devices specific to a user it may be able to better learn a users patterns and preferences and react accordingly to provide the best possible outcome for that user

43 ML Model Optimization at the Edge

The Need for Model Optimization at the Edge
Given the constrained resources and the inherently dynamic environments in which edge devices must operate model optimization is a crucial part of machine learning in edge computing The current most widely used methodology consists of simply specifying an exceptionally large set of parameters and giving it to the model to train on This can be feasible when hardware is very advanced and powerful and is necessary for systems such as Large Language Models LLMs However this is no longer viable when dealing with the devices and environments at the edge It is crucial to identify the best parameters and training methodology so as to minimize the amount of work done by these devices while compromising as little as possible on the accuracy of the models There are multiple ways to this and they include either optimization or augmentation of the dataset itself or optimization of the partition of work among the edge devices

Edge and Cloud Collaboration
One methodology that is often used involves collaboration between both Edge and Cloud Devices The cloud has the ability to process workloads that may require much more resources and cannot be done on edge devices On the other hand edge devices which can store and process data locally may have lower latency and more privacy Given the advantages of each of these many have proposed that the best way to handle machine learning is through a combination of edge and cloud computing 

The primary issue facing this computing paradigm however is the problem of optimally selecting which workloads should be done on the cloud and which should be done on the edge This is a crucial problem to solve as the correct partition of workloads is the best way to ensure that the respective benefits of the devices can be leveraged A common way to do this is to run certain computing tasks on the necessary devices and determine the length of time and resources that it takes An example of this is the profiling step done in httpsieeexploreieeeorgstampstampjsptparnumber10818760tag1 EdgeShard 1 and httpsdlacmorgdoipdf10114530933373037698 Neurosurgeon 4 Other frameworks implement similar steps where the capabilities of different devices are tested in order to allocate their workloads and determine the limit at which they can provide efficient functionality If the workload is beyond the limits of the devices it can be sent to the cloud for processing

The key advantage of this is that it is able to utilize the resources of the edge devices as necessary allowing increased data privacy and lower latency Since workloads are only processed in the cloud as needed this will reduce the overall amount of time needed for processing because data is not constantly sent back and forth It also allows for much less network congestion which is crucial for many applications


Optimizing Workload Partitioning
The key idea for much of the optimization done in machine learning on edge systems involves fully utilizing the heterogenous devices that are often contained in these systems As such it is important to understand the capabilities of each device so as to fully utilize its advantages Devices can very greatly from smartphones with more powerful computational abilities to raspberry pis to sensors More difficult tasks are offloaded to the powerful devices while simpler tasks or models that have been somewhat pretrained can be sent to the smaller devices In some cases as in httpsieeexploreieeeorgabstractdocument8690980 MobileEdge 2 the task may be dropped altogether if the resources are deemed insufficient In this way exceptionally difficult tasks do not block tasks that have the ability to be executed and therefore the system can continue working 

Dynamic Models
Given the dynamic nature of the environments that edge devices must function as well as the heterogeneity of the devices themselves a dynamic model of machine learning is often employed Such models must keep track of the current available resources including computation usage and power as well as network traffic These may change very often depending on the workloads and devices in the system As such training models to continuously monitor and dynamically distribute the workloads is a very important part of optimization Simply offloading larger tasks to more powerful devices may be obsolete if the devices has all of  its computing resources or network capabilities being used up by another workload 

The way this is commonly done is by using the profiling step described above as a baseline Then a machine learning model utilizes the data to estimate the performance of devices andor layers During runtime a similar process is employed which may update the data used and help the model refine its predictions Network traffic is also taken into account at this stage in order to preserve the edge computing benefit of providing lower latency Using all of this data and updates at runtime the partitioning model is able to dynamically distribute workloads at runtime in order to optimize the workflow and ensure each device is utilizing its resources in the most efficient manner Two very good examples of how such a system is specifically deployed are the Neurosurgeon and EdgeShard systems shown above

Horizontal and Vertical Partitioning
There are 2 major ways that these models split the workloads in order to optimize the machine learning Horizontal and vertical partitioning 3 Given a set of layers that ranges from the cloud to edge vertical partitioning involves splitting up the workload between the layers For example if a large amount of computational resources is deemed necessary this task may go to the cloud to be completed and preprocessed One the other hand if a small amount of computational power is required this type of work can go to edge devices Such partitioning also depends on the confidence and accuracy level of the given learning If the accuracy is completed on an edge device and found to be very low it can be sent to the cloud on the other hand if the accuracy is already fairly high and the learning model needs smaller work to reach the threshold deemed acceptable it may be sent to edge devices to free up network traffic on the cloud and reduce latency 3

The second model of partitioning is called horizontal partitioning This involves splitting among the devices within a certain layer rather than among the layers themselves This is similar to what has been described in previous sections as it allows a means for fully utilizing the heterogenous abilities that are found in edge devices Similar functionality and determination to what is found in horizontal partitioning is done but all of the devices that the workload is split across function on the same layer 3 To fully optimize a machine learning model both horizontal and vertical partitioning must be used 



Distributed Learning
Distributed learning is a process in which instead of giving all of the data to the nodes each node takes in and processes only a subset of the overall data then sends its results to a central server which contains the main model These periodic updates are done by each node and by only processing part of the data it is much more easy for edge devices to handle these workloads It can also reduce the time and computational burden on the cloud and network because it is not only the central server performing all of the computations One popular method of accomplishing this  is by using parallel gradient descent Gradient descent by itself is a very useful means of training a model and parallel gradient descent uses a similar process but instead of a single operation it aggregates the gradient descent calculated by each node in order to update the central model This efficiently utilizes each node and makes sure that the data that is used to update the model does not exceed the memory constraints of the edge devices being used as nodes


Asynchronous Scheduling One important aspect of distributed learning is the means by which the updates are given to the model Each node may have different amounts of data memory and computational power and therefore the time it takes to process and update will not be the same Synchronous algorithms make sure that each node finishes its respective processing and then all of the calculations from all nodes are sent to update the central model Although this can make the updating easier any nodes that lag behind the others will greatly reduce the speed at which the model is trained this also leaves nodes idle while others are still processing and can be highly inefficient To optimize this after each node has finished its respective processing it sends everything to the main server for an update rather than waiting for all the others to finish However this requires some more communication as after each update every node must get the updated model for the central server this can be challenging to repeatedly do but the efficiency that is gained is often worth it

Federated learning Federated learning is another means by which the data as well as computational burden is distributed among a set of nodes thus reducing network traffic and strain on the central servers It is similar to distributed learning but the key difference lies in the data partitioning Unlike distributed learning data used in federated learning is not shared with the central servers Instead only local data from each of the nodes is used to train the model Then the only part shared with the central model is the updated parameters A key aspect of this is that federated learning provides a greater amount of data privacy which is crucial for certain applications dealing with sensitive data Therefore it is especially useful to utilize edge devices to perform federated learning Federated learning is discussed in detail in chapter 5 of this wiki

Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a method of machine learning in which a pretrained model is sent to the different nodes for further processing and finetuning The initial training of the model may involve a very large amount of data and could place a major burden on the device that must execute it which may not be feasible for edge devices Therefore the bulk of the model training is done by a more powerful machine such as the cloud and then the pretrained model is sent to the edge device This can be useful as it reduces the computational burden on the edge device and allows it to finetune the model using the data it collects without having to completely train the whole system One form of this is knowledge distillation in which a smaller model can be trained to mimic that of a larger model This may often be the case when edge and cloud systems are used in a combined way

Methods of Data Optimization

Data Selection Certain types of data may be more useful than others and therefore the ones that most affect the accuracy of a model can be offloaded to edge devices This decreases the workload on them because less data must be processed while also conserving the accuracy of the model as much as possible Some larger data may not be needed such as only putting Small Language Models on edge devices that can handle simple commands and prompts rather than having to offload an entire LLM onto the device which may overload its computational abilities and not provide enough use

Data Compression Data can be compressed to a smaller form in order to fit the constraints of edge devices This is especially true given their limited memory and also makes the workload smaller Quantization discussed previously is a prevalent example of this

Container Workloads Container workloads can be very useful as they provide all resources and important data the device needs for processing the work By examining the computational abilities of the device different sized workloads can be allocated as deemed necessary to maximize the efficiency of the training

Batch size tuning The batch size used by a certain model is very important when considering the memory constraints of edge devices Batch sizes that are smaller allow for a quicker and more efficient means of training models and are less likely to lead to bottlenecks in memory This is related to partitioning because the computing and memory capacity of the devices available are very important factors to consider

Utilizing Small Language Models SLMs
Large Language Models LLMs have become a prevalent system recently and are able to do and help with a variety of tasks However running and training an LLM requires a significant amount of computational resources which is not feasible when working with edge devices Most modern LLMs are cloud based but this may lead to high latency and increased network traffic especially when working with a large subsystem of nodes 

One way that a similar system can be achieved on edge devices is by using SLMs These are not as accurate and do not have the vast knowledge of LLMs or the amount of data they are trained on but for the purposes of basic applications and edge devices they can be sufficient to accomplish many tasks They are also often finetuned and trained to accomplish the specific tasks which they are deployed for and are much faster and resourceefficient than LLMs They can also provide much more privacy because they are able to be run on local devices without sharing user data to the cloud This can be useful for a wide variety of edge applications If needed and privacy constraints permit they can query and LLM as needed for more complicated tasks This means that not every prompt leads to a query and thus network traffic privacy and latency constraints are still preserved

Synthesis

In summary edgeoriented machine learning optimization requires an integrated approach that combines modellevel compression with systemlevel orchestration Techniques such as quantization structured and unstructured pruning and knowledge distillation reduce the computational footprint and memory requirements of deep learning models enabling deployment on resourceconstrained devices without substantial loss in inference accuracy Concurrently dynamic workload partitioning heterogeneityaware scheduling and adaptive runtime profiling allow the system to allocate tasks across edge and cloud tiers based on realtime availability of compute bandwidth and energy resources This joint optimization across model architecture and execution environment is essential to meet the latency privacy and resilience demands of edge AI deployments
